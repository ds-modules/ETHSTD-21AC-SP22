For this purpose it is not necessary to view all the columns of our table so we will use another table function, `select()` to cut out the unnecessary columns. We will be keeping `year`, `institution_name`, and `designed_capacity`. In order to use this table in the future, we will assign it to a new variable called `year_and_design_capacity`.\n",

We then append this to our table's name using dot notation. This tells the computer in which table to look for those columns.\n",

Notice that we didn't attach any particular table's name via dot notation. These are not table functions but basic plot functionalities from another Python library we loaded at the start of this notebook! In order for them to work, however, they must be run *after* you have created a plot. Take a look below!"

Given this change over time, we wanted to compare it with the actual number of people within California's prisons and see how the two quantities correlated.

We can noted earlier that the monthly count for this institution was above 324, which could indicate monthly counts for male and female inmates, leading to a double count.
